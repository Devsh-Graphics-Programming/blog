## How to get started
- Fork the repo

- Write the technical article or project post by placing the file in the right directory inside content/
- Make sure you hookup the right "front matter", thats the first few lines each markdown file needs to have, containing meta data about your post
- Try it out locally by installing zola, you can get it [there](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) (it comes with instructions for all OSes)
- Once installed, simply run `zola serve` and follow instructions on the screen, it will most likely point to `http://localhost:1111`
