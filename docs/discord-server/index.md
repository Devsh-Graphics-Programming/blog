We are a diverse community of graphics programming enthusiasts from humble hobbyists to full-on professionals, with all levels of mastery of Vulkan, Direct3D, OpenGL, etc! 
We love answering interesting questions and trying to solve graphics-related problems; we hope you join in on the fun, whether by asking your own questions or answering others’, or sharing your adventures in the graphics programming world.

## Rules

* Be nice and respectful.
* When you ask a question:
  * a. Don't ask if you can ask, just ask (in the appropriate channel)
  * b. Debug the issue yourself first to the best of your ability. Use the actual debugger of your editor/IDE.
    * [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/docs/getting_started/quick_start.html)
    * [PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/introduction/)
    * [apitrace](https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace/blob/master/docs/USAGE.markdown)
  * c. Explain your issue in detail. “it doesn’t work” is not a sufficient problem description
  * d. Explain what you've tried already
  * e. Support your question with code/screenshots/renderdoc captures if possible
  * f. Simplify code to only what’s relevant to your question, don't post screenshots of code, remember you can format code on discord
  * g. Be patient and don't crosspost if you don't get an immediate response
  * h. Don’t ask for help with LLM output (e.g. ChatGPT)
* Don't ask us to do your homework for you.
* Don't send links using URL shorteners.
* Any form of advertisement must be cleared with moderators first. This includes invite links to other discord servers. Crypto, NFT and web3 posts are never allowed.
* Do not discuss or distribute illegal content (even if leaked by a third party), hacking or cheating technologies, no discussing modifying existing games (games with actual official mod support are allowed), or post gory or otherwise disturbing imagery.
* Keep discussions on-topic
* No discussion of politics, religion, etc. in any channels
* No usernames/nicknames that are website links or allude to website links

## Infractions

Disruptive behavior will result in warnings or bans:

- Warning (lasts 3 days)
- Last warning (lasts 7 days)
- 7-day ban
- Permanent ban

3 strike rule: warnings count as 1 strike, strikes last 3 months, 3 active strikes result in a permaban.

## Roles

We have a few custom roles on our server, some are self-assignable while some are granted by the mods. Head over to ⁠reaction-roles to pick the api or coordinate system!

## Community

We have a Github organization where we host:

- Our server mascot good-froge, we like frogs (see #frogshed)
- deccer-cubes, a challenging asset for your renderer; can you handle the cubes? give them a try and report your findings to #"This mesh will crash your engine", you might get a custom role!
- rvpt, a realtime vulkan path tracer project
- A collection of useful graphics programming resources
- this very blog

We also have a website with additional resources and are currently revamping a "screenshot of the month" gallery

We have a few channels for showing off your work or encouraging others to help you think out loud when developing your project:

- `#⁠showcase`, show off your creations (please use threads for discussion)
- `#⁠wip`, similar to showcase, but for incremental progress and discussion thereof
- `#⁠the-bug-collective`, for all your buggy, glitchy renders
- `#⁠community-projects`, the place to think-out-loud/yell/complain/rant/progress/blog about your UE5/starcitizen/minecraft clone

If you have suggestions for how to improve the server, be it new emojis, moderation, channels/categories, let us know by making a post in `⁠#suggestions`.

Enjoy and have fun!
